# 🧠 Senior Citizens Welfare Eligibility & Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a data-driven system to verify beneficiary eligibility and detect fraudulent patterns in a senior citizens welfare program.

The goal is to reduce wrongful approvals, eliminate fraud, and improve transparency using rule-based validation and Machine Learning anomaly detection.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Government welfare programs often face:
- Duplicate registrations
- Fake biometric records
- Suspicious banking activity
- Ineligible age submissions

This system detects and flags such anomalies automatically.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

✅ Age eligibility validation  
✅ Residency verification  
✅ Biometric frequency analysis  
✅ Bank account duplication checks  
✅ Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest  
✅ Fraud flagging system  

---

## 📊 Machine Learning Approach

An Isolation Forest model was implemented to identify anomalous patterns in:

- fingerprint_count
- bank_count
- age distribution

This helps detect suspicious applications that deviate from normal patterns.
